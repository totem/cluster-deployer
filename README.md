Totem Cluster Deployer

It provides the ability to deploy applications to a fleet cluster. It adds a layer of abstraction and provides a simple RESTFul API for the deployment. For deploying using totem, it also participates in SWF Workflow for completing an end-to-end deployment workflow. (The SWF component is confiurable and is turned off by default).
